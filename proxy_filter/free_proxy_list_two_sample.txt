    I also have this file where proxies are listed with details. But i need the ip address and port only.
    For this purpose I made the extracting_proxies.py file to extract the proxies and concatenate with proxies 
    in the free_proxy_list_one.txt file and store them into free_proxy_list.txt file

## Example proxies in this file
